# BERT_vs_SBERT_YT
This project compares the BERT (small_bert/bert_en_uncased_L-2_H-128_A-2/1) and Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) models on the Youtube videos dataset. The data columns in consideration are the description and the title.
Highlights:
Developed a recommender system using BERT and SBERT to analyze video titles and descriptions.
Compared the impact of noisy data and demonstrated that SBERT was faster than BERT. Also, proved that high cosine similarity doesn't always lead to better recommendations.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLP.
